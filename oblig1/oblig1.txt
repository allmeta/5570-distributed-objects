Barrier:
In theprogram I have 4 processes that are called twice (2 times)

they barrier makes them wait until a condition is satisifed, i.e.
when all the processes are waiting.
the barrier then signals them all to continue.
they then print out "doing something"

prod/cons:

in this program I have "market" which has two conditions: full and empty

if the market is full, the producer then waits for the consumer to signal the "full" condition, so the producer can continue

likewise with empty: the producer signals the consumer when the market is no longer empty, so it can continue

the program stops at the end of the sequence: 30
